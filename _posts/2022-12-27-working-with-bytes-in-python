bytes is immuntable
bytearray is mutable
you can iterate over / access indices of bytes and bytearrays same you would a list

binascii.hexlify() bytearray or bytes to hex string
bytes.fromhex() hex string to bytes
hex() int to hex string (might want to do [2:]  to trim off "0x")
base64.b64encode() bytearray or bytes to base64 string (b64decode() to reverse)

from Crypto.Util.number import *
bytes_to_long()
